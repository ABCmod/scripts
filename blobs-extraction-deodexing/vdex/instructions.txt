with Superr Kitchen free, extract the system.img from the latest factory image WITHOUT deodexing with the kitchen
then, from the folder where you have the extract-files.sh, run:

./extract-files.sh PATHtoEXTRACTEDsystem VENDOR DEVICE

for exampe:
./extract-files.sh /home/ezio/Android/SuperRs_Kitchen_v1.1.7.5/superr_t/system/ huawei angler

a few other blobs like ims and TimeService are already deodexed so just extract the vendor.img with Superr 

PS: you might need to update blobs and paths in the blobs.txt list (provided one is for angler) according to the device
